# This program makes ChatGPT a trivia gameshow host.
# You have to answer the questions correctly to win
# It's 100% functional but with some issues
#
# - Main issue:
# - Couldn't figure out how to not get duplicate questions from OpenAI
#
# Here are the npm's I used (npm install)
# express
# body-parser
# dotenv
# axios
# cors
# path
# ejs
#
# Setup:
# do docker-compose up
# navigate to path
# run server (node server.js) - make sure .env (api key) is correct and located
# navigate to http://localhost:3001
# Play Trivia!
#
# Notes:
# Used Assignment 4 starter
# I used AI to assist with CSS, HTML structure, and server formatting
# Also helped with fixing errors, bugs, and the parsing section
#
# OpenAI API Key not included, use your own.
